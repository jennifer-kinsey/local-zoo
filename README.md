# Local Zoo Project - Orlando Wetlands Park

This is a web app built in Angular 2 without CLI or a database.
This app allows a user to track animals at a zoo, but I made it specifically in mind for Orlando Wetlands Park.
This is one of my all time favorite places and a wonderful sight for bird watching. You can track birds and other species with this app and specifically see adult, juvenile, or all sightings of animals.
